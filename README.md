### Ingredients:
- **2 cups orzo**
- **1 oz sun-dried tomatoes in oil** (chopped)
- **1 recipe mock feta** (or 1.5-2 cups real feta) [mock feta recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/mock-feta-cheese-vegan-substitute-118182)
- **1/2 cup red onion**, diced
- **1 bell pepper**, diced (use two colors for a vibrant presentation)
- **1/4 cup parsley**, chopped
- **1/4 cup olives**, sliced (or chopped for a more even distribution in the salad)
- **Salt, pepper, red wine vinegar, olive oil** (adjust to taste)
- **Optional:**
  - **1 block herbed extra firm tofu**, diced
  - **1 green apple**, diced

### Preparation:

1. **Prepare Mock Feta:**
   - Follow the instructions provided in the linked recipe to make the mock feta. Set aside to cool or refrigerate until ready to use.

2. **Cook the Orzo:**
   - Boil the orzo according to the package directions but ensure not to overcook; al dente is key to prevent it from becoming mushy.
   - Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process immediately.
   - Toss the cooked orzo with a little olive oil to keep it loose and prevent sticking.

3. **Mix the Salad:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked orzo, prepared mock feta, sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, bell pepper, parsley, and olives.
   - If using, add the diced tofu and green apple for additional texture and flavor.
   - Dress the salad with olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning according to taste.

4. **Chill and Marinate:**
   - Cover the salad and refrigerate overnight. This allows the flavors to meld together beautifully, making each bite perfectly seasoned.

### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve chilled as a side dish or a main for lunch.
- Garnish with extra parsley or a sprinkle of vegan cheese before serving to enhance its visual appeal and flavor.
