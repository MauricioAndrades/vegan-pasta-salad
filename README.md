####Pasta Salad Recipe:
* `2 cups orzo`
* `1 oz sun-dried tomatoes in oil`(dice sundried tomatoes)
* `1 recipe mock feta  (or 1.5-2 cups real feta) **see above for feta recipe link**`
* `1/2 cup red onion, diced`
* `1 bell pepper, diced` (or 1/2 and 1/2 different color bellpeppers for presentation)
* `1/4 cup parsley, chopped`
* `1/4 cup sliced olives` (dice olives)
* `Salt, pepper, red wine vinegar, olive oil to taste`
* Optional:
    * I like to `add 1 block of herbed extra firm tofu.`
    * I also like `1 green apple, diced.`

1) Make mock feta

2) Cook orzo as instructed on package
    * don't overcook or the orzo will stick/clump in end
    * add olive oil and toss while cooling for it to stay nice and flow-ey

3) Combine all other ingredients


4) Let sit overnight and chilled for best flavor
